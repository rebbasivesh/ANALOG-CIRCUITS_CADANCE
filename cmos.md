CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology is widely used in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuits due to its low power consumption and high noise immunity. When working with CMOS in Cadence design tools, the process typically involves the following stages:

CMOS Design Flow in Cadence

Schematic Design:

Virtuoso Schematic Editor: Used to draw the transistor-level schematic of the CMOS circuit. This includes placing NMOS and PMOS transistors, and interconnecting them to form the desired logic gate or circuit.

Simulation: Use Spectre or ADE (Analog Design Environment) to simulate the schematic.
