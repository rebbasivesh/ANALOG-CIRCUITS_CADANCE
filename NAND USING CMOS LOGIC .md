--->  NAND gate, a fundamental building block in digital electronics, performs the inverse of the AND operation, outputting a high signal unless all its inputs are high. 
It is widely used in constructing various logic circuits due to its functional completeness, allowing any Boolean function to be implemented.

The Boolean expression for a NAND gate with inputs \(A\) and \(B\) is:

This represents the logical NOT of the AND operation between \(A\) and \(B\).
