**Characteristics of Common-Gate Amplifier-**
<body>

 **Low Input Impedance:** The CG amplifier has a low input impedance, which is beneficial for impedance matching in certain applications.<br>
**High Output Impedance:** The high output impedance makes it suitable for driving high-impedance loads.<br>
**Voltage Gain:** The voltage gain of a CG amplifier is typically less than or equal to unity (Av ≤ 1), but it can be higher depending on the transistor's parameters and the load resistance.<br>
**Current Gain**: The current gain is unity (Ai ≈ 1), meaning the output current is approximately equal to the input current.
